\title{
 Position Specific Scoring Matrices from a set of aligned sequences
}
\description{ Calculate a PSSM of a set of DNA aligned sequences, taking into account background probabilities. The output is the logodds matrix.
}
\usage{
CalculPSSM(matriu, Prob)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{matriu}{ Set of DNA aligned sequences}
  \item{Prob}{ Probability distribution of the nucleotides in the background model}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
logodds: logodds matrix calculated as a log2 of the frequency matrix
